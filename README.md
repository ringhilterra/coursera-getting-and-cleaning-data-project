# coursera-getting-and-cleaning-data-project

Ryan Inghilterra course project for Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data Course.

Before running the run_analysis.R script from my github you need to

1: Download the dataset into  your working directory and make sure unzipped

So you should have the "UCI HAR Dataset" directory in your working directory 
spelled exactly that way which contains all the data for the project

Then you can run my script and it will work.

The end results are in finaldata.txt
